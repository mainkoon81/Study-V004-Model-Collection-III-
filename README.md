> **Parametric Models**
 - It has a fixed number of parameters and makes **stronger assumptions** about the data, so it works well if the assumptions turn out to be correct, but it may perform badly if the assumptions are wrong.
 - It is computationally faster.
> **Non-Parametric Models**
 - It uses a flexible number of parameters, and the number of parameters often grows as it learns from more data.
 - It makes fewer assumptions about the data. 
 - It is computationally slower.

## 1> K-Nearest Neighbor Methods
> keywords: K, distance, ties, NaN, **K-D_Trees**(booster)
 - One of the great things about KNN is that we can add in new data to update the model very easily!
